AR Foundation enables you to create multi-platform augmented reality (AR) apps with Unity. In an AR Foundation project, you choose which AR features to enable by adding the corresponding manager components to your scene. When you build and run your app on an AR device, AR Foundation enables these features using the platform's native AR SDK, so you can create once and deploy to the world's leading AR platforms.
